		<p class="card-text"> Flow Map Design: 
		Koylu’s paper on FlowMapper mentioned that Albers Equal Area or Web Mercator are best for regional maps. I chose 
		Web Mercator since Mexico didn’t fit neatly into the U.S. or South American Albers Equal Area projections. The Light 
		Gray basemap was used because it provides a good outline of the different regions in Mexico without being cluttered 
		by specific city names. It also provides a good contract for the arrow colors. Koylu’s paper on FlowMapper also 
		mentioned that hiding node symbols may be useful for visualizing flows between regions to highlight the nature of the 
		flows. For that reason, I chose to hide node symbols using zero stroke-width and full transparency for the fill color. 
		The monotone arrowhead was selected because of the accuracy and speed with which the arrow can be interpreted. Koylu’s 
		paper on symbology found that arrowheads are useful in direction tasks which is important for interpreting migration 
		data. Divergent color schemes were not found to be helpful in the correctness and response time for interpreting flow 
		maps, so a solid color arrow was used. Only the top 60 flows were mapped to limit visual clutter. From a color theory 
		perspective, I wanted to use at least one color from the Mexican flag. The flag is green, white, and red. Green and red
		aren't great to pair together due to the occurrence of red-green color blindness which is why I chose purple and green.
		<div>
		Flow Patterns:
		Mexico has 32 states, but the majority of the flows seem to center around the state of Mexico. The largest flows either 
		come from or go to the state of Mexico. These largest flows are exchanged with states nearby Mexico to the east and northwest. 
		There are flows coming from and going to states further north and further southeast, but those flows are much smaller in 
		volume. While the nodes are transparent to better show the regional flows and the state names, there seems to be an outline 
		of the nodes for Mexico and the Federal District because of the number of flows entering and leaving those areas.
